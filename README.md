</p>

## How to play
1. Start YGOPro.
2. Click on `Deck Edit` to build your deck. Remember to add 1 _Cardfight!! Vanguard Rules_!<br>
If you do not build your deck according to the following rules, you will lose the game and have to rebuild your deck:<br>
● Your deck must be exactly 50 cards.<br>
● Your deck must have exactly 16 [trigger units](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Trigger).<br>
● You cannot have more than 4 trigger units with "HEAL" in your deck.
3. Choose a [grade](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Mechanics) 0 card from your main deck and put it face down on your vanguard circle (VC) as your "[first vanguard](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/First_Vanguard)".<br>
4. Shuffle your deck and [draw](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Specific_Actions#Draw) 5 cards. Then, you have 1 chance to choose any number of cards from your hand, put them on the bottom of your deck, draw the same number of cards, then [shuffle](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Specific_Actions#Shuffle) your deck if you returned any cards.<br>
5. Both players simultaneously turn their first vanguards face up.
6. During your [Stand Phase](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Fight_Rules#Stand_Phase), turn all of your units from [Rest](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Specific_Actions#Stand_and_Rest) to [Stand](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Specific_Actions#Stand_and_Rest).
7. During your [Draw Phase](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Fight_Rules#Draw_Phase), draw 1 card.
8. During your [Ride Phase](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Fight_Rules#Ride_Phase), you may [ride](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Ride) once. Choose a unit from your hand whose grade is one greater than or equal to your current vanguard's grade, and [place](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Specific_Actions#Place) it on your (VC) as [Stand]. This is called a "normal ride".<br>
9. During your [Main Phase](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Fight_Rules#Main_Phase), you may do the following actions in any order and as many times as you want:<br>
● Choose a unit card from your hand whose grade is equal to or less than your vanguard's grade, and place it on one of your rear-guard circles (RC) as [Stand]. This is called a "normal [call](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Call)". You may normal call a unit onto a (RC) that already has a unit on it. The previous unit that was on that circle is [retired](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Specific_Actions#Retire) (put into your drop zone).<br>
● Move one of your rear-guards between the front and back row (RC) of the same column, or exchange the places of two rear-guards on (RC) in the same column. You cannot move a rear-guard to a different column with this action.<br>
● Use an [ACT] ability of one of your cards.<br>
● Play a [normal order](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Order) from your hand whose grade is equal to or less than your vanguard's grade. You may play one normal order per turn.
10. During your [Battle Phase](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Fight_Rules#Battle_Phase), except the first turn, you may [attack](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Specific_Actions#Battle) with your [Stand] units in the front row against your opponent's units.<br>
	10.1. During your Start Step, you can choose to attack and continue to the Attack Step, otherwise proceed directly to the End Phase.<br>
	10.2. During your Attack Step, choose one of your [Stand] units in the front row and [Rest] it, then choose one of your opponent's units in the front row to attack.<br>
	10.3. During your Guard Step, your opponent may perform the following actions in any order and as many times as they want:<br>
		● Choose a unit card from their hand and normal call it to their guardian circle (GC) as [Rest].<br>
		● Choose a rear-guard with the Intercept skill from their front row, other than a unit being attacked, and move it to (GC) as [Rest] (this is not considered a call).<br>
		● Discard a card with "HEAL" from their hand to call a G guardian from face down in their G zone onto (GC) as [Rest]. They may only do this if both players' vanguards are grade 3 or greater, and the number of face-up G guardians in their G zone is three or less.<br>
		● Play a blitz order from their hand whose grade is equal to or lower than their vanguard's grade. They may play one blitz order per turn.<br>
	Each time your opponent calls or moves a new unit to (GC) during a battle, the unit becomes a "guardian". While the guardian is on (GC), its [Shield] value is continuously added to the [Power] of the unit it is guarding. A unit with no printed [Shield] value is regarded as having [Shield] 0.<br>
	10.4. During your Drive Step, perform a "drive check" equal to your attacking unit's [drive](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Drive). Reveal the top card of your deck and put it into your trigger zone. If that card has a trigger and is of the same [clan](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Clans) as a unit on your field, resolve all effects indicated by the trigger on the card, in any order you like. Then, if the card is still in the trigger zone, put that card into your hand, regardless of whether it has a trigger or not.<br>
	10.5. During your Damage Step, compare the [Power] of the attacking unit with the [Power] of the unit being attacked. If the attacking unit's [Power] is greater than or equal to the unit being attacked, then the attack hits. If the attacking unit or the attacked unit leaves the field, or if the controller of any of these units is changed, or if any of these units is moved to another circle, then the attack is canceled and does not hit.<br>
	If the attack hits, one of two situations occur, depending on the unit that was hit:<br>
	● Vanguard: The attacking unit deals damage equal to its [Critical] to the attacked unit. If the attacking unit's [Critical] is 0 or less, then no damage is dealt.<br>
	● Rear-guard: The unit being attacked is retired.<br>
	Before damage is applied, retire all guardians on (GC), regardless of whether or not the attack hit.<br>
	If your opponent's vanguard is dealt damage by the attack, your opponent performs a "damage check" equal to the damage dealt. They reveal the top card of their deck and put it into their trigger zone. If that card has a trigger and is of the same clan as a unit on their field, then they resolve all effects indicated by the trigger on the card, in any order they like. Then, if the card is still in the trigger zone, they put the card into their damage zone face up, regardless of whether a trigger effect was activated or not.<br>
	10.6. During your Close Step, all effects that happen at the end of a battle occur. After this, return back to your Start Step and choose whether or not to attack again. If you cannot or choose not to attack, the Battle Phase is over.
11. During your [End Phase](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Fight_Rules#End_Phase), all actions and effects are activated and resolved at the end of a turn. The following actions take place right away, and the turn player performs them in the following order:<br>
	● Return all G units on your (VC) and (RC) to your G zone face up.<br>
	● Return locked cards and deleted units on your field to normal state by turning them face up.<br>
	Then, abilities with "at the beginning of end phase" and "at end of turn" are activated. Then, effects with "until end of turn" cease to be applied.

**Important:**
1. This YGOPro game is only compatible with the Microsoft Windows operating system.
2. Online play is not supported.
3. At least 1 player must have _Cardfight!! Vanguard Rules_ in their deck, otherwise the mod will not function properly.
4. Enable `Do not check Deck` when creating a game to avoid an error due to a player having more than 3 copies of a card with the same name in their deck.

## How to win
1. If a player's damage zone has six or more cards, that player loses.
2. If a player's deck has no cards, that player loses.
3. If a player has no vanguard, that player chooses a card from their soul, and rides it as [Stand]. However, if that player's soul has no cards they can ride, that player loses.
4. A player may win or lose the game automatically as a result of an effect, such as _[Star-vader, "Omega" Glendios](https://cardfight.fandom.com/wiki/Star-vader,_%22Omega%22_Glendios)_.
